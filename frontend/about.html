      Welcome to the Deaf and Dumb Communication Portal, a platform designed to help people with hearing
      and speech impairments connect easily. Users can communicate using text, speech-to-text, and even sign 
      language recognition (coming soon).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to make communication inclusive and accessible for everyone, bridging the gap between 
      individuals through technology.
